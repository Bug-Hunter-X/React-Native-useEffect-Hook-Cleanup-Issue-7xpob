This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native development involving the `useEffect` hook.  The initial code lacks a proper cleanup function in the `useEffect` hook, resulting in memory leaks when the component unmounts.  The solution demonstrates the correct implementation with the cleanup function to address the issue.
